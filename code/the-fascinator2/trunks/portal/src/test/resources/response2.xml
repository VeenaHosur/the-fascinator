          This study investigated 15 child care centres to find out their responsiveness to the needs of families from non-Anglo backgrounds. Results of this
          study showed a need to improve service quality in child care to best serve the needs of children from non-Anglo backgrounds. Forty Filipino, 15
          Cambodian and 30 Sudanese families were involved in this study.

          Complex Systems-of-Systems, which form the subject matter of the research presented here, may be considered to be systems that are constituted of
          several components, each of which could themself be regarded as being a complete system in its own right. These component systems are typically
          largely managed independently of one another. They each have their own intrinsic goals which they are capable of fulfilling autonomously. These goals
          are additional to any to which they might contribute as part of the overall System-of-Systems that is being investigated. Systems-of-Systems are
          epitomised by features such as the prevalence of complex webs of mutual interdependency amongst their component systems, the involvement of a broad
          diversity of stakeholders and the participation of a number of independent decision-makers, each of whom competes with the others for strictly limited
          resources. Furthermore, the components of Systems-of-Systems may often be found to be widely scattered across an extensive geographical region.
          Sometimes such systems may even span global distances. Complex Systems-of-Systems of such a nature would appear to be becoming ever more prevalent in
          the increasingly interconnected and ever shrinking world which is engendered, in particular, by the proliferation of modern information and
          communication technology. Systems-of-Systems may arise in both commercial and public sector contexts, hence commercial organisations and governments,
          alike, confront the daunting challenge of planning, establishing and maintaining novel systems of this type. However, it is to be anticipated that
          significant difficulties might be encountered in applying existing systems engineering methods, which were designed for dealing with far more
          monolithic types of system, to the treatment of Systems-of- Systems. Instead, the successful achievement of acceptable resolutions to the various
          Systems-of-Systems issues and conundrums with which the responsible planners can be expected to be confronted would appear to demand the application
          of sophisticated distributed decision aids, in order to alleviate the the intolerable burden which the decision-makers would otherwise be forced to
          endure. Such aids need to be able to take a genuinely fair and unbiased account of the interests of a multitude of stakeholders. At the same time,
          they must be able to satisfactorily accommodate the enforcement of a range of highly involved and intricate constraints upon the various alternative
          interventions which might potentially be contemplated. In order to underpin the development of decision aids of the kind demanded, it has been sought
          to establish some basic theoretical foundations for Systems-of-Systems. This body of theory has then been applied to the identification of the methods
          which might be most suitable for the treatment of Systems-of-Systems questions. Finally, some decision-support tools which are intended to facilitate
          the implementation of the methods that have been recommended have been described. Any attempt to dictate a single â€œbestâ€� intervention to the
          decision-makers would generally be totally unacceptable. As a result, the objective which has been pursued has been to seek to filter out and identify
          a relatively sparing number of what would appear to be the most reasonable alternatives from some much more profuse range of possibilities. These may
          then be afforded more intensive scrutiny by the pertinent decision-makers.

          China has been changing from a centrally planned to a market economy. Its journey has not been a smooth one and is not likely to be easy in the years
          to come. One of its industry sectors, the chemical industry, which represents approximately 4.6% of its national GDP, is facing challenges in the
          changing market dynamics. The Chinese government has applied administrative actions rather than simply relying on the market to address these
          challenges. Fragmentation has been reduced by closing down inefficient chemical plants; merging various companies to form groups. It has also
          attempted to privatise government owned enterprises by corporatisation and marketisation. Corporatisation of government-owned enterprise refers to
          alteration of their ownership to create joint stock companies. Marketisation refers to listing those privatised enterprises on the stock market. The
          objective of this research was to find out whether taking these administrative actions is the best strategy for the Chinese government-owned chemical
          industry rather than making it more effective by building up state owned chemical enterprises? core competencies and core capabilities. The principal
          argument of this thesis is based on the resource-based view (RBV). Since there is no previous study on the application of the RBV in the Chinese
          chemical industry, this thesis can be seen as the first step to applying it in conducting research in this industry. Through the literature review,
          interviews with the senior executives of the Shanghai Chemical Bureau, and discussion with industrial experts, six testable hypotheses were developed.
          These hypotheses were tested by using a questionnaire survey with 150 respondents from a sample randomly selected among the chemical companies listed
          in the Chinese Chemical Catalogue 2001-2002. In addition in-depth case studies of two chemical enterprises were used to increase the breadth and depth
          of the research findings. The first subject is a privatised state-owned enterprise with its shares listed in the Shanghai Stock Exchange. The second
          subject became a state-owned enterprise again in 2000 through several changes in ownership. The research methods were specifically chosen as being
          appropriate to the investigation into the effect of administrative measures on the company?s long-term performance compared to that of using core
          capabilities. Multiple T tests, Cronbach?s Alpha and ANOVA were used to analyse the quantitative research data and to ensure the results are
          statistically significant. The quantitative research findings indicate that building core capabilities is more effective than privatisation and group
          structure for the Chinese chemical companies to improve performance. Findings from the two case studies not only confirm the effectiveness of using
          core capabilities to improve performance but also reveal how and why core capabilities affect company performance. Based on these findings it is
          concluded that developing Managerial Capability, Human Resources Capabilities (in particular corporate culture), and Marketing Capabilities are more
          effective than privatisation and group structure for the Chinese chemical companies to improve long-term performance. This thesis also validates the
          appropriateness of applying RBV in the Chinese chemical industry.

          This dissertation investigates how masculinities are understood and practiced through the body and how such practices are shaped and limited by
          modernist theories about gender. The research argues that postmodern theory allows for a greater inclusivity of genders and bodies otherwise
          marginalised by modernity. A qualitative postmodern and poststructural methodology, combined with a research method involving the collection of all
          data via an on-line questionnaire, disrupts modernist, dualistic thinking about the body and gender. By distancing the physical body from the research
          method, and thus separating, temporarily, discourses of gender which inhabit the body, this research creates counter-hegemonic spaces to re-articulate
          masculine identities and practices within the postmodern condition. Furthermore, the postmodern theory and methodology informing this work unsettles
          the belief that physical bodies can be counted on to reveal consistent truths. The contextualisation of this work includes a chapter that recounts
          various historical moments where technological advancements made way for the re-consideration and re-negotiation of gender and bodies. The
          intersections of technology and modernity are examined along with the rise of the postmodern condition and the advancement of computer technologies.
          Shifts in understanding, influenced by postmodern theory and human-computer interaction, are discussed in relation to their challenges to modernist
          boundaries of ?the real? and, in turn, the possibilities of gender articulations. Additionally, a chapter containing critical researcher reflexivity
          through an autobiographical account of masculinities and schooling acts to illustrate some of the complexities, contradictions, privileges and
          counter-hegemonic possibilities of masculinities and bodies. Although the majority of the research participants identified as ?male?, some identified
          as ?female? and others identified as ?intersex?. The geographic identities of the respondents included Australia, The United Kingdom, Ireland, The
          United States, and Japan. The data were analysed using postmodern and poststructural theory. The subjectivity and the role of the researcher in the
          analysis of data were interrogated alongside the words of the participants. The responses were grouped into four areas: Being and Knowing; The Body
          Engendered; Bodies On-Line and On the Line, and New Articulations. In all four areas the participants? words demonstrate tensions between modern and
          postmodern understandings of bodies and genders. Computer technologies often replicate modernist images of gender and bodies, yet at the same time
          they provide a postmodern space of multiplicity, fluidity, and hybridity, where rigid modernist configurations cannot hold. The analysis illuminates,
          diffracts, disrupts, and highlights disjunctures and new possibilities for gender and bodies mediated by contemporary computer and Internet
          technologies. Lastly, Benjaminian dialectical images were used to transform fixed modernist beliefs about gender and bodies and to move the reader
          toward alternative ways of understanding gender which are not body dependent.

          This study examines the experiences of teachers and students in secondary English classes, as they engage in the reading of contemporary adolescent
          fiction, when such fiction is set as a class text. This study also includes an examination of students' perceptions of such reading, and of reading in
          general. The aim of the study is to add to the knowledge about what actually goes on inside English classrooms during the teaching of literature, and
          within that field, to specify how teacher-student interaction in the classroom defines and positions the kinds of meanings that are made of literary
          texts. Therefore, this study focuses on the teaching of units of work related to the reading of adolescent fiction novels by three South Australian
          English teachers, based in three different metropolitan schools.The central focus is on the teachers? plans for these units of work, and on the
          outcomes: that is, on teacher-student interactions during the time spent in class on the novel, and on students? written and oral responses. Thus this
          study also focuses on the learning that took place in these classrooms, as students made meaning from their reading.In the review of the literature,
          the role of the literary novel as the class ?set text? in its several historical contexts is examined, as well as current theories of reading, of
          pedagogy, and of literary criticism. Finally this study is placed in the context of other related studies and its contribution to the field
          explained.An interpretive approach is employed and methods of educational ethnography are used to what was visualised from the outset would be
          qualitative research in the form of case studies. Some quantification is used in this research to report on a small-scale survey, using a
          questionnaire to create a ?readers? profile of the cohort of student-informants as a whole. Metaphors were used to encapsulate the teachers? teaching
          styles, and their intentions and practices analysed to uncover the underlying theories on which these intentions and practices were based. Throughout,
          but especially in the final chapter, the related notions of ?enjoyment? and ?the teaching of reading? at secondary school levels, as well as the
          concept of reflectivity, are examined for their impact on reading pedagogy. Finally, some suggestions are made for possible and desirable future
          research and teacher professional development.

          UUProblem Members of the Singapore Heavy Equipment Spare Parts Industry face a multitude of challenges in developing their pricing strategy and
          practice, and in establishing, developing, and maintaining successful relational exchanges. They are unable to obtain any guidance from the pricing or
          relationship marketing literature. These works are either too complex or too general to be of any use to industry members. Consequently, much of
          industry strategy and practice occurs without the benefit of theory. UUThe Method An extensive review of existing literature was conducted in the
          major subject areas of pricing and relationship marketing. Literature on other subjects of channels, marketing mix, strategy, value, commitment,
          trust, cooperation, and satisfaction were also reviewed. A survey instrument was developed and field research was administered to 35 channel members
          of the industry. The results were analysed using SPSS 11. The results were used to construct a model of the role of pricing in relationship marketing.
          The model was constructed using Factor Analysis, Correlation Analysis and Regression Analysis. UUThe Findings The findings are all based on the
          perception of the channel members. Nine factors were extracted. These non-trivial factors to the Singapore Heavy Equipment Spare Parts Industry are: -
          Downstream supply considerations; - Product/Stock allocations; - Price gap resolution; - Perception of value/profitability; - Business volume; -
          Intermediate business relationships; - Leads and referrals; - Favourable pricing; and - Long-run relationships. At 5% significance (2-tailed), 4
          construct paths were supported. These are: - Support gap correlates with actual price; - Support gap correlates with value; - Support gap correlates
          with price gap; and - Price gap correlates with value. At 5% significance (2-tailed), 8 hypotheses were supported. These are: - Price gap resolution
          correlates with commitment; - Price gap resolution correlates with cooperation; - Price gap resolution correlates with satisfaction; - Importance of
          constructive acts correlates with improved business volume; - Expression of intention to increase business correlates with increased business; -
          Importance of value correlates with increased business; - Value (through profitability) correlates with increased business; and - Importance of value
          correlates with improvements in: - Trust; - Commitment; - Cooperation; - Satisfaction; and - Increased business. UUConclusion Pricing has a profound
          and multi-faceted role in relationship marketing. It is a powerful tool. It has a role as a market tool with new relationships, as a development tool
          in the growth phase of relationships, and as a control tool in the mature phase of bilateral relationships between first and second echelon
          distributors. The study recommended that channel members utilise this tool concept and the management of value, price, and support gap in relational
          exchanges.

          During the 1990's, most Hong Kong companies experienced extremely high Voluntary Turnover among middle managers. This thesis attempts to find the
          causes of such turnover through quantitative analysis and at the same time assess the state of Succession Planning implementation in 10 subsidiaries
          of US multinational companies as a potential remedy to such turnover. Lack of career advancement and promotion opportunities was found by employees to
          be the leading cause of voluntary turnover whereas employers believe basic salary and other remuneration components are the main causes. In 9
          companies out of 10, Succession Planning is found to be short on basic success criteria such as formalization, buget, support from top management,
          I.T. support, integra- tion with strategic HR planning, accountability and continuous review process.

          The purpose of this study was to investigate whether Confucian values based on the four virtues and five relationships influence the style of the HRM
          practices adopted by Locally owned firms (LOFs) and Foreign owned firms (FOFs) based in Singapore. Confucian values emphasize a way of life. They are
          based on first cultivating oneself with the basic four virtues highlighted by Confucius (551 - 479 BC). Secondly, through the influence of the
          individual on others (via the five relationships, namely ruler-subject, father-son, brother-brother, husband-wife and friend-friend illustrated by
          Confucius), a 'perfect' world with peace and harmony can be created. This study investigates the degree to which the four distinct virtues - 1)
          human-kindness (ren), 2) integrity (yi), 3) propriety (li) and 4) knowledge (chi) and the five relationships, 1) ruler-subject, 2) father-son, 3)
          husband-wife, 4) brother-brother and 5) friend-friend, were adopted to underpin the practices of Human Resource Management (HRM) in Singapore. The
          target group of respondents chosen was executives, who were directly influenced by the style of human resource management in the firm.
          Electronics/technology related firms based in Singapore were the chosen group. The executives were chosen from electronics/technology related firms
          because these firms formed the most important industry, responsible for the well being of Singapore's growth (24% of GDP as stated by the Department
          of Statistics; 1999) and expected to continue so for the next 10 years. Managers from the same firms were given another set of questionnaires to
          verify the responses obtained from the executives. From the result obtained, it showed that there were influences of Confucian values on the five
          human resources functions tested. The executives' responses provided evidence on whether or not a certain trait or style has been used in the firm.
          The managers' responses, on the other hand, helped to verify that the trait or style was due to the influence of Confucian values as a whole and not
          other cultures or religions. The entire survey and interviews were carried out over twenty months from 1998, during which responses obtainable from
          both the managers and executives from each firm were analyzed. The data were analyzed using cross-tabulations and chi-square tests because
          cross-tabulation is one statistical tool which required only at least 5 responses in each cell for a reliable analysis to be conducted (Yong, 1994).
          Letters were then sent out to the Heads/Managers of the target firms, conducting interviews to obtain more insights to argue the survey data. Two
          interviews were conducted, taped and results obtained from the quantitative approach, helped further clarify earlier interpretations. This research
          showed that Singapore-based electronics/technology-related firms, regardless whether they were locally owned or foreign owned, showed that they were
          influenced by Confucian values in most aspects of the human resource practices. In addition, from the study, it showed that there were no significant
          differences between locally owned firms and foreign owned firms in terms of the degree of influence Confucian values have on the style of the
          management. This demonstrated that Chinese culture (in this case - Confucian values) - local/host country's culture played a stronger influence on the
          style of management in businesses conducted in Singapore than the organization's culture. This finding is important as most past research findings
          such as Rodrigues (1996) used to state that the organizational culture of the foreign-owned firms often have stronger influence on the practices
          adopted in firms regardless of the country that they were in. Lastly, after analyzing the responses obtained from the survey, the study justified that
          four virtues and only three (i.e. ruler-subject, friend-friend, father-son) of the five relationships outlined by Confucius has an impact on the style
          of HRM amongst Singapore-based firms in the technology/electronics-related industry.

          Generating employee rosters on a 24 hour, 7 day per week basis taking into account fluctuating demand for employees, employee skills, working
          conditions, training and employee preferences, while ensuring efficiency and equity between the employees is a very difficult task due to the very
          large number of possible rostering combinations available. The research done in this thesis, supervised by Dr. David Panton and Dr. Graham Mills, and
          in association with Prof. Drew Dawson, sets to solve this exact problem for CS Energy's Swanbank Power Station located in Queensland, Australia. At
          this site, there are 48 full-time and 8 part-time employees, each with up to 5 different skill levels (from a possible 8 skill levels), working across
          two power stations located 150 metres apart. The rostering solution had to take into account CS Energy's current employees and their current level of
          multi-skilling in such a way that employees maintained currency in all their skills. A rostering system termed dynamic rostering was developed which
          enabled CS Energy's current employees to be rostered, while being flexible enough to handle fluctuations in employee demand, changes in employee
          numbers and employee preferences, and maintaining the multi-skilled nature of the employees. Other types of rostering such as cyclic rostering, could
          not be implemented for the Swanbank Power Station as the assumption of constant demand and all employees having the same skills could not be met. To
          solve this dynamic rostering problem for CS Energy, a number of sophicated integer programs were developed. Integer programs are powerful tools when
          solving problems with the following structure: minimise an objective; subject to ensuring some constraints are not violated. Integer programs suit
          this rostering problem as there is a need to minimise the amount of under and overstaffing, subject to ensuring working conditions, skill maintenance
          and equity between employees is met. One large integer program is required to solve each two week roster period. Since the large integer programs are
          difficult to solve, we use reduction techniques such as column expansion, reduced column subset, and branch and price to reduce the initial large
          integer program to an integer program of a more solvable size. Through its simplicity and the suspected degeneracy of the initial integer program, the
          reduction technqiue called reduced column subset proves the most effective for giving good solutions in the least time. Branch and price techniques
          which set out to solve the problem to optimality do find better solutions by an average of 1-4%. Therefore for actual rosters, the most efficient
          methods of branch and price, and branch and price with cutting constraints would be most appropriate. For scenario testing, the quicker methods of
          column expansion and reduced column subet would be the most appropriate. The final rosters developed for CS Energy using these mathematical
          techniques, dramatically increased the efficiency of the rosters when compared to their current manual methods. They also provided a quantifiable
          measure of equity for employees.
