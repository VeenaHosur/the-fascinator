Sun of Fedora
=============

This application is a web portal front-end for searching institutional
repositories. It is based on the Apache Solr indexing software.

Requirements
============

  * Java 5 (or greater)
  * Apache Tomcat 5 (or greater)
  * Maven 2

Installation
============

1. Check out the source code and change to the directory it was checked out to

   svn co https://rubric-central.usq.edu.au/solrsvn/public/sun-of-fedora
   cd sun-of-fedora

2. Copy the sample portal configuration to ~/.sun-of-fedora directory. Where
   '~' is the home directory for that user that runs the Tomcat app server.

   cp src/main/resources/sample_portals.xml ~/.sun-of-fedora

   Note: If you wish to use a different directory to store the configuration,
   set the SUN_OF_FEDORA_HOME environment variable to point to that directory.

3. Build the web package using Maven. This will create target/sun-of-fedora.war.

   mvn compile war:war

4. Copy the web package to your Tomcat's webapps directory.

   cp target/sun-of-fedora.war /opt/fedora/tomcat/webapps

5. Startup Tomcat and open a browser to http://$server:$port/sun-of-fedora to
   test if the application was deployed correctly.

Portal-specific stylesheets
===========================
Each portal can be given a distinct look by using a different CSS. The CSS file
must be named 'style.css' and placed in the following directory:

  $TOMCAT_HOME/webapps/sun-of-fedora/WEB-INF/classes/portal/$PORTAL_NAME

where $PORTAL_NAME is the name of the portal that stylesheet applies to.
